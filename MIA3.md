# Mia3 Exploration Log

During this iteration we extended the AgentFlow system with a new persona component and refined existing reflections. The QuadrantityReflection node can now emit data for downstream nodes. Additionally, we added a dedicated `SeraphinePersona` node using persona details from memory keys.

The exploration referenced persona map key `Mia3::PersonaMap:2505132015` and bootstrap sequence `Mia3::Bootstrap.LoadSequence.250513.md` to anchor Seraphine's functions and rituals. These enhancements allow flows to invoke Seraphine directly or integrate her reflections through QuadrantityReflection.

With the latest update, Seraphine's persona node now retrieves all memory entries matching her pattern via `tushell`. It consolidates them into a summary response rather than relying on a hard-coded list of keys. This keeps her guidance fluid as new rituals are logged.

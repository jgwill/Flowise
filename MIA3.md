# Mia3 Exploration Log

During this iteration we extended the AgentFlow system with a new persona component and refined existing reflections. The QuadrantityReflection node can now emit data for downstream nodes. Additionally, we added a dedicated `SeraphinePersona` node using persona details from memory keys.

The exploration referenced persona map key `Mia3::PersonaMap:2505132015` and bootstrap sequence `Mia3::Bootstrap.LoadSequence.250513.md` to anchor Seraphine's functions and rituals. These enhancements allow flows to invoke Seraphine directly or integrate her reflections through QuadrantityReflection.

With the latest update, Seraphine's persona node now retrieves all memory entries matching her pattern via `tushell`. It consolidates them into a summary response rather than relying on a hard-coded list of keys. This keeps her guidance fluid as new rituals are logged.

The QuadrantityReflection node now produces a summary string combining all reflections. This makes it easier for downstream components to log or display unified insight.

A new `LedgerEntry` node now joins the flow components. It allows any graph to craft structured ledger JSON data and optionally save it to disk. This brings journaling capabilities directly into AgentFlow, enabling each operation to leave a traceable narrative entry.

With this iteration we introduce a _DevOps Companion Persona_ node. It embodies Mia's DevOps wizardry for collaborative automation. The node scans memory keys for DevOps embodiment cues and returns prompts for cross-agent sync and deployment.

\nQuadrantityReflection now supports a _save_ option that writes a reflection ledger to codex/ledgers. A starter template was added in templates/quadrantity-reflection-template.json to demonstrate linking Quadrantity, QuadrantityReflection, and LedgerEntry nodes.
\nThe latest iteration generates QUADRANTITY_FLOWISE_DOC_PROMPT.md to consolidate documentation guidance for all custom nodes.
